# Optimization Modeling

## Course Description:
This course explores modeling and solving business decision problems. It covers optimization models including linear programming, integer programming, transportation, assignment, network optimization, and nonlinear programming. Students learn to analyze scenarios, formulate models using software tools, interpret output, and present project reports.

## Learning Outcomes:
- Identify problems appropriate for optimization.
- Understand the challenges with solution techniques with optimization problems.
- Learn to convert written descriptions into optimization problems.
- Learn to solve optimization problems using open source software.

## Software:
- Microsoft Excel Solver

- Python
  - Pandas: Importing and manipulating data from Excel files.
  - Pyomo: Formulating and solving optimization models.
  - Matplotlib: Creating plots and visualizations.
  - Seaborn: Generating scatterplots for location visualization.
  - Numpy: Performing numerical computations and array operations.

## Optimal NHL Team for Draftkings Exam Grade: 100%
The project focuses on solving an optimization problem in the context of Daily Fantasy Sports on DraftKings, specifically for the National Hockey League (NHL) contests. The objective is to select an optimal lineup of players based on certain constraints and rules. The project utilizes Python and optimization models to solve the problem. It involves exploratory data analysis using historical data and applies optimization techniques to select lineups. Two optimization problems are solved: one based on historical information and the other based on actual game data.

### Data Source:  [TBA](TBA)

### Exam Highlights:
- Exam Part 2: Create a team based on the actual data and following constrainsts
  - The fantasy team must have nine players.
  - The salary of your nine players may not exceed $50,000.
  - You need players from at least three different teams.
  - The makeup of the team in terms of positions is:
   - Two Centers (C)
   - Three Wings (W)
   - Two Defenders (D)
   - One Utility (C, W, or D)
   - One Goalie
